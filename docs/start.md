## Managing Memory

*Address Space*

:   Is the set of addresses that a process can use to address memory. Each process has its own, independent of those belonging to other processes. By having such abstraction, `ADDR 28` in a process maps to a different physical address when compared to `ADDR 28` in another process.


**Base and Limit** registers may be used to implement such concept. 

> Programs are loaded into consecutive memory locations wherever there's room and without relocation during loading. Then it's run, the base register is loaded with the physical address where the program begins in memory and the limit register with the length of the program. Each time the a process references memory the CPU hardware adds the base value to the address generated by the process before sending the address. Note that there's a disadgantage here: there's the need fo addition and comparison on every memory reference.

*Swapping*

:   consists of bringing in each process in its entirety, running it for a while, then outting it back on the disk. Such action is necessary when there's the need for moore memory than the machine has.

*Virtual Memory*

:   allows programs to run even when they're only partially in memory.

*Memory Compaction*

:   compacts the memory by removing freed memory that lies between used memory. Usually not done as it requires a lot of CPU time.
